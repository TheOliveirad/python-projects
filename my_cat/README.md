# Welcome to My Cat
***

## Task
The task is to create a program that replicates the functionality of the "cat" command. It reads the content of one or more files and displays them on the terminal.
The main difference between the cat comand and this program, is that the program is not able to take options.

## Description
I solved this problem by creating a Python script that opens and reads each file provided as an argument (filenames).
I used the open() function to open the files in read mode ("r"), and using the read() function inside the print() command, it prints their content to the terminal.

## Installation
There is no special installation required. You just need to have Python installed. 

## Usage
To use this program, just run it from the command line with the filenames you want to display.
The folloing command "python my_cat.py filename1 filename2" will print the content of both files in the terminal.

### The Core Teamlped me understand how to r
This project was developed by me, Diogo Oliveira, as part of a project for Qwasar Silicon Valley. It heeplicate the behavior of the cat command using my own Python code. 
This project is an important milestone in my progress toward earning my bachelor's degree.
