# Python Projects 🐍

This repository contains a collection of Python mini-projects built during my training at Qwasar and personal exploration. Each folder contains a focused exercise or tool covering file handling, scraping, API calls, and logic-based programming.

## 🗂️ Projects

### 🐱 [`my_cat`](./my_cat/)
Mimics the Unix `cat` command — reads and prints file contents via command-line input.

### 🌐 [`my_first_scraper`](./my_first_scraper/)
Simple HTML scraper using Python's `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to fetch and parse website content.

### 🎬 [`my_imdb_api`](./my_imdb_api/)
Connects to an external movie API (like OMDb) to retrieve film metadata via HTTP requests.

### 🔢 [`my_roman_numerals_converter`](./my_roman_numerals_converter/)
Converts integers to Roman numerals using rule-based character mapping.
